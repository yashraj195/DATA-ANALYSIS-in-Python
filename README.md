# Data Analysis with Python  
## Project Overview  

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a streaming service dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about users, their subscription types, watch time, and churn behavior. The project aims to answer various business questions, such as churn rate by subscription type, average age of users, user engagement by devices, and more.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named "streaming_service_data.csv". The dataset contains the following columns:

user_id: Unique identifier for each user  
subscription_type: Subscription plan (Basic, Standard, Premium)  
age: Age of the user  
join_date: Date the user joined the service  
last_active_date: Last time the user was active on the platform  
total_watch_time: Total hours the user spent watching content  
favorite_genre: User's most-watched genre  
num_devices: Number of devices the user has used  
churn_flag: Whether the user has churned (1 if churned, 0 otherwise)  

## Analysis  
The project uses various Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The analysis includes:

Data exploration: Summary statistics, data types, and missing values  
Data cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and adding new columns  
Data visualization: Distribution of subscription types, total watch time, and user engagement by devices  
Data analysis: Churn rate by subscription type, average age of users, user engagement by devices, and more  

## Recommendations  
### 1. Improve Retention Rates for Basic Users  
The analysis shows that Basic users have a higher churn rate compared to Premium users. To improve retention rates, consider offering more features or incentives to Basic users, such as exclusive content or discounts.
Consider implementing a loyalty program that rewards users for their continued subscription.
### 2. Target Action and Drama Fans  
The analysis shows that users who prefer Action and Drama genres have higher average watch times. Consider creating more content in these genres to attract and retain users.
Use targeted marketing campaigns to reach fans of these genres and promote relevant content.
### 3. Optimize Content for Multi-Device Users  
The analysis shows that users with multiple devices tend to have higher watch times. Consider optimizing content for multi-device users, such as by providing seamless playback across devices.
Use data to identify which devices are most commonly used together and optimize content accordingly.
### 4. Improve User Engagement through Personalization  
The analysis shows that users who engage with the platform more frequently tend to have higher watch times. Consider implementing personalization features, such as recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
Use data to identify which features and content are most engaging for users and prioritize development accordingly.
### 5. Monitor and Adjust Pricing Strategy  
The analysis shows that Premium users have a lower churn rate and higher CLTV. Consider monitoring pricing strategy and adjusting as needed to optimize revenue and retention.
Use data to identify which pricing tiers are most effective and adjust pricing accordingly.
### 6. Invest in Data-Driven Decision Making  
The analysis shows that data-driven decision making can lead to improved retention rates, increased engagement, and optimized revenue. Consider investing in data analytics tools and talent to support data-driven decision making.
Use data to identify areas for improvement and prioritize development accordingly.  
These recommendations are based on the analysis and are intended to provide actionable insights for improving the streaming service.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding user behavior and identifying areas for improvement in a streaming service. The insights gained from this analysis can inform business decisions and help the streaming service to better serve its users.
